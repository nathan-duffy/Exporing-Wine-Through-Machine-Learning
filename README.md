## Exporing Wine Through Machine Learning

**Overview:** 

Inspired by my interest in the educational aspects of wine tasting, I decided to use machine learning methods for prediction and exploration of an extensive dataset on the subject.  First I implemented a logistic regression to predict variety based on description. Next, a K-Means clustering model to group the wines into clusters that attempt to generally describe each unique variety.

**Code:** Check out my completed Jupyter Notebook above (Wine ML.ipynb)

**Project Outline:**
<br>
<br>1. Data Cleaning & EDA
<br>2. Feature Selection & Creation
<br>3. Model Training
<br>4. Model Testing
<br>5. Conclusions
<br>6. Deliverable

**Findings:**

I was able to create a surprisingly accurate learning model predicting the variety of wine based on the description given by the sommelier.  Plus accurately describe these wines using a sort of artificial sommelier being fed large amounts of wine spiels.  Refer to the final writeup and Jupyter notebook for a more in depth analysis.
