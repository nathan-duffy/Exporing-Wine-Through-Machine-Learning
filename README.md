## Exporing Wine Through Machine Learning

Data from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews

**Project Outline:**

<br>1. Data Cleaning & EDA
<br>2. Feature Selection & Creation
<br>3. Model Training
<br>4. Model Testing
<br>5. Conclusions
<br>6. Deliverable

**Findings:**

I was able to create a surprisingly accurate learning model predicting the variety of wine based on the description given by the sommelier.  Plus accurately describe these wines using a sort of artificial sommelier being fed large amounts of wine spiels.  Refer to the final writeup and Jupyter notebook for a more in depth analysis.
